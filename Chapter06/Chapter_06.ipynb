    "<b>NOTE:</b> When you execute the following code cell you will see the full verbose execution of the Multi-agent delegator agent. You may also notice that at certain points the delegator failed to invoke the tool. This happens in case the LLM was unable to capture the required variables for the tool, at which point the CrewAI framework will retry the call by re-crafting it's inputs until it gets a proper tool call (often with smaller or cheaper LLMs). This is unfortunately one of the drawbacks of generic implementations, however with more custom implementations with CrewAI, you can steer the model to generate appropriate tool calls everytime given all the information is present.<br/>\n",
