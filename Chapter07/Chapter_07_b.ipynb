A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation. In the following example, you will notice that we interact with the agent with two different thread_id and the agent is able to keep the memory separate for each thread rather than updating the global long-term memory.\n"

Whenever we define the agentic workflow with that namespace, regardless of the thread it will refer to the globally stored preferences.

    "\n",
    "Episodic memory preserves successful interactions as learning examples that guide future behavior. Unlike short-term memory which stores facts, episodic memory captures the full context of an interactionâ€”the situation, the thought process that led to success, and why that approach worked. These memories help the agent learn from experience, adapting its responses based on what has worked before. In the following example, we create a travel agent system with episodic memory using the `langmem` library. The code defines a `TravelEpisode` schema that captures four critical elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the customer's travel request \n",
    "- the agent's planning considerations\n",
    "- the specific recommendation provided, and \n",
    "- the positive outcome that resulted. \n",
    " \n",
    "When the system processes a conversation where a traveler expresses concerns about Italian crowds, it stores how the agent successfully redirected them to less-crowded alternatives while still satisfying their desire for art and cuisine. This structured approach to remembering successful interactions allows the system to develop a repository of effective strategies that can be applied to similar situations in the future."
